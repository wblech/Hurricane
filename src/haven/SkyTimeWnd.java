/* The sky's debug clock, as a window.
 *
 * It shows dt, drawn elevation and azimuth beside the wall clock because those
 * three are exactly what glprobe is invoked with -- so a screenshot taken here
 * and a render from docs/superpowers/harness/skybox/ can be taken at the same
 * instant by reading them off rather than by guessing. That is the point of the
 * window; the slider is just how you get there.
 *
 * Closing it returns the server's clock. There is no stored preference and no
 * state that outlives the widget, so a restarted client is always live. The
 * cost is real and intended: comparing two sky modes means keeping this open,
 * so it appears in every screenshot taken this way. A screenshot whose hour
 * could be a lie is not evidence, and a visible window is the cheapest way to
 * keep the two kinds of picture apart. */
