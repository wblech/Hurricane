/* Fades everything under MapView's basic slot -- terrain and gobs both --
 * into the sky's own horizon colour, so the draw-distance edge stops being
 * a hard cut.
 *
 * Distances: MapView.view is 2 CUTS (MapView.java:969-970 divides by
 * MCache.cutsz), cutsz is 25 tiles and tilesz is 11 units, so one cut is 275
 * units and the rendered area is 5x5 cuts. The player sits inside the centre
 * cut, so the nearest terrain edge is between 550 and 825 units away. Fog
 * must be fully opaque by 550 or the cut shows.
 *
 * Those are distances from the PLAYER, and the fog measures them as such:
 * horizontal distance in map space, from a player-position uniform. Do not
 * "simplify" this to length(eyev). Eye distance is a different quantity --
 * FreeCam sits 400 units back by default and can pull out to 3000
 * (MapView.java:285,304) -- so eye-space fog would haze the player's own
 * feet and would turn the whole world one flat colour when zoomed out.
 * Horizontal rather than 3D distance is also deliberate: terrain height
 * should not decide how fogged a tile is. */

     * erased most of the terrain the client had already drawn.
     *
     * 260 still took visible terrain, and so did 110. The band only has to be
     * wide enough to hide the cut boundary; everything past that is view the
     * client already loaded and drew. 70 units is about six and a half tiles.

     * Zoomed out is the case that decides this. FreeCam pulls back to 3000
