     * NIGHT_RATE steepens that curve so it has done most of its work early,

     * midnight come out where the shipped sky puts it, so the gate's other
     * crossing is a crossfade between two equal values. That division has to be

     * 0.038 * 0.6921 = 0.026301 divided by it is 0.026374.

     * 12.0 shipped first. 1 - exp(sh * RATE) does not remove the inversion, it
     * COMPRESSES it: a steeper curve saturates sooner and then still has to
     * fall to zero at the horizon. At 12.0 it was still at 46% of its midnight
     * value with the sun 2.9 degrees down, where the shipped curve was at 7%
     * -- so the last ten minutes before sunrise got a blue wash laid over
     * exactly the moment the sky had started to warm, and the ground haze went
     * from brown to grey. Whole-frame median red minus blue at 05:50, in
     * levels: shipped +20.6, at 12.0 +10.1, at 5.0 +19.6.
     *
     * 4.0 replaced it, and was chosen from a sweep that only ever pointed the
     * camera AT the sun. Turn 180 degrees and the trade reverses, monotonically
     * across the whole family -- night minimum as a fraction of that shader's
     * own midnight, facing the sun and facing away:
     *
     *      shipped  -23.7%  -40.8%      5.0   +3.1%  -21.6%
     *          4.0   +2.8%  -25.5%     12.0   +3.2%   -6.4%
     *
     * No value fixes both, because the structure will not allow it: away from
     * the sun the sky is held up by sk_nit alone, which must reach zero at the
     * horizon, while the dawn's warmth carries pow(mu, 5) and is welded to the
     * sun's own bearing. Curing the far side needs a dawn term that is not
     * weighted by mu -- a different shape, not a different constant. 5.0 buys
     * four points of it for about one level of morning hue, and is a stopping
     * place, not a solution. See ADR-0016.
     *
     * The 12.0 defect hid for a whole review, and not because the instrument
     * was blind. Ablating the two terms at 05:50 gives a median red minus blue
     * of -50.9 for the night alone and -16.0 for the glow alone against -35.8
     * for both, so the median sees them ADDITIVELY and would have shown the
     * cooling. It did show it: 05:50 was in the table, at +20.6 falling to
     * +10.1, under a sentence saying the hue barely moved. The failure was
     * prose overruling a row of its own table. Read the rows.
     *
     * TWI_DAWN is the morning's own twilight falloff. TWI is set so the glow is
     * 1% of its horizon value at 18 degrees of depression; at 3.50 it is still
     * 44% there, which is what puts a warm side on the sky an hour before the
     * disc arrives. Its 0.10 coefficient is not a choice either: both sides of
     * the mix reduce to 0.10 at sh = 0, which is what keeps sunrise itself
     * bit-identical. Warmth added by raising it would move 06:00. */

     * a sine about noon -- 04:51 and 19:08 arrive at the shader as the same
     * number to 8e-17, and the sky they produce is bit-identical. So elevation
     * cannot tell dawn from dusk, and anything keyed on it moves both. The
     * sun's horizontal direction can: it is 180 degrees apart at the two ends
     * of the day.
     *
     * The parameter is the Y-UP sun, the one sky_yup produced -- yup maps world
     * (x, y, z) to (x, z, y), so this vector's .xz IS the world's horizontal
     * plane, which is the plane lightang is measured in. Handing it the
     * world-space sun would put the sun's height into .z and skew the gate
     * silently.
     *
     * The 0.25 half-width is in dot space, not in azimuth: it puts the
     * crossfade between 75.5 and 104.5 degrees off east, which the sun takes
     * about an hour and 56 minutes to cross. That is the parameter that decides
     * how long each turn takes, and it was not derived -- it was chosen to be
     * slow enough that neither crossing can read as an edge, and both crossings
     * sit in hours nobody was tuning. Narrowing it sharpens both fences.
     *
     * Any gate that halves a circle has two boundaries. This one turns where
     * the sun is due north or south -- midnight and noon -- and at both the dot
     * is 0, so this returns exactly 0.5. Neither is a decision; both are the
     * fence. What makes that cheap differs per term:
     *
     *   sk_nit is genuinely inert at noon -- the day/night blend gives it zero
     *   weight with the sun up -- and at midnight NIGHT_SCALE makes the two
     *   sides of its mix equal, so half of either is the same number.
     *
     *   The glow is NOT inert, only small. Its only gate is exp(-abs(sh) * k)
     *   and k is what this swaps: at noon 3.2e-09 against 1.6e-03, so 8.1e-04
     *   survives at 0.5. That is 2.7e-05 on the darkest pixel after the
     *   tonemap, and most of the 2.4e-03 measured at midnight.
     *
     * Both are under a level of 255 and both are accepted. They scale with
     * TWI_DAWN, though: at 1.00 instead of 3.50 the noon leak is nineteen times
     * larger and would stop being invisible. The crossings are cheap at this
     * width, not free at every width.
     *
     * The zero-length guard is horB's, for the same reason: normalize(vec2(0))
     * is NaN and would poison the whole sky. Unreachable with a real sun, which
