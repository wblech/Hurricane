     * RISES, 0.5625 to 0.5882 rad across dt 0.808 to 0.821 with ast.night set.
     * It is the lighting rig the shadows are built from, not an astronomical
     * sun, and the client is right to keep it that way -- shadows that swing
     * to infinity at dusk would look far worse than a sun that does not set.
     *
     * Two defects followed from reading it as a sun. The disc was drawable
     * only where that sweep happened to land inside the band this projection
     * can show, which tops out at 31.75 degrees: about a third of its range,
     * and then only with the azimuth inside the 53-degree horizontal field,
     * so on the order of 5% of the time. And every night branch in SkyLib
     * keys on the elevation going negative, so the night sky, the dusk band
     * and the stars were all unreachable -- at 19:16 game time with ast.night
     * set, sky_baseA still computed a day factor of 1.583, saturated to full
     * daylight over night-lit terrain.
     *
     * PEAK compresses the arc into the drawable band with room left so the
     * disc is never clipped by the top edge. It is a compression, not a
     * physical elevation: the sky this shader draws is a fiction to begin
     * with, since a camera pitched 45 degrees down with a 15-degree half
     * field never sees real sky at all.
     *
     * Day runs dt 0.25 to 0.75, and both edges are measured. ast.night first
     * went true at dt = 0.75060 and first went false at 0.25161, with the
     * sample before it, 0.24810, still true -- so the morning edge is bracketed
     * around 0.25 to within the probe's five game-minute resolution. The
     * client's own calendar agrees independently: Cal.java:63 puts the sun on
     * the dial at (dt + 0.75) * 2pi, which is the horizontal at dt 0.25 and
     * 0.75 and the top at 0.50. */

    /* What the compression above costs everything downstream.
     *
     * The drawn arc peaks at PEAK. The sun the server's own lighting describes
     * peaks at NOON -- the maximum of lightelev, measured at 1.1781 rad and
     * reached at dt 0.500 to 0.525, solar noon. (lightelev is not this sine
     * over the rest of the day; it flattens onto a floor at 0.4018. Only the
     * peak is borrowed, because only the peak is being matched.)

     * PHYSICAL falloff applied to the sun has to undo the compression with it
     * first -- exactly as ADR-0005 makes anything round on screen divide by
     * sky_gain. Skipping it is what kept the twilight glow alive at -38 real
     * degrees, painting dawn over the sky at 03:37 game time. See ADR-0010.
